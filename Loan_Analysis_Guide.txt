Title: Bank Loan Portfolio — Column Dictionary, Problem Statement & Detailed Analysis Guide

Dataset: Bank_Loan_Portfolio_3000.csv
Grain: One row per loan application, 2023–2024 across common cities.
Noise: ~4% missing, ~2% outliers, casing inconsistencies, a few duplicates.

---------------------------------
1) Column Descriptions
---------------------------------
• Loan_ID: Unique loan identifier.
• Application_Date: Date of application (YYYY-MM-DD).
• City: Applicant city (6-city set).
• Region: Geographic region derived from city.
• Age: Applicant age.
• Employment_Type: Salaried | Self-Employed | Business.
• Income (INR): Monthly income.
• Loan_Amount (INR): Approved amount; correlated with Income and purpose.
• Loan_Tenure_Months: Tenure in months.
• Interest_Rate_Percent: Annual interest rate (%).
• Credit_Score (300–900): Higher is better.
• Debt_To_Income_Ratio: EMI / Income.
• Approval_Status: Approved | Rejected.
• Default_Flag: 1 if defaulted (only meaningful when approved).
• Loan_Status: Active | Paid | Defaulted | Rejected.
• Customer_Rating (1–5): Internal score.
• Risk_Category: Low | Medium | High.

---------------------------------
2) Business Problem Statement
---------------------------------
Reduce default risk while improving approval accuracy and customer experience.

Key Questions
• Which factors most strongly predict default risk?
• How does Debt_To_Income_Ratio interact with Credit_Score and Income?
• Are approval rates and default patterns consistent across cities/regions and employment types?
• What thresholds (Credit_Score, DTI) lower default with minimal approval loss?

KPIs
• Approval Rate = % Approved
• Default Rate = % Defaulted among Approved
• Portfolio Yield proxy = mean(Interest_Rate_Percent) × (1 − Default_Rate)

---------------------------------
3) Data Quality & Cleaning
---------------------------------
• Deduplicate on Loan_ID; also check [City, Application_Date, Income]-level duplicates.
• Standardize casing for City, Employment_Type, Approval_Status, Loan_Status, Risk_Category.
• Missing: Income/Credit_Score/Employment_Type — impute median or model-based per employment group.
• Outliers: cap Loan_Amount, DTI, Interest at reasonable percentiles per employment type.
• Logical checks: Default_Flag must be 0 if Approval_Status=Rejected.

---------------------------------
4) Exploratory Analysis
---------------------------------
A. Univariate
• Distributions: Income, Loan_Amount, Interest, Credit_Score, DTI.
• Counts: Employment_Type, Approval_Status, Loan_Status, Risk_Category.

B. Bivariate
• Credit_Score by Default_Flag (box/violin).
• DTI by Default_Flag & Employment_Type (KDE/box).
• Income vs Loan_Amount (scatter), colored by Approval_Status or Default_Flag.
• Approval & Default Rate by City and Employment_Type (bar).

C. Threshold & Risk Segmentation
• ROC/AUC for default prediction.
• Partial dependence: DTI and Credit_Score.
• Segment grid: bins of Credit_Score × DTI with default rates and counts.

---------------------------------
5) Feature Engineering
---------------------------------
• Buckets: Credit_Score bands (<650, 650–719, ≥720), DTI bands.
• Interactions: Employment_Type × Credit_Score; City/Region effects.
• Seasonal: month/quarter of application.

---------------------------------
6) Modeling Ideas
---------------------------------
• Classification: Default_Flag using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
• Calibration: Reliability curves; Brier score.
• Policy simulation: Approve if (Credit_Score≥X AND DTI≤Y) — approval vs default trade-off.

---------------------------------
7) Suggested Visuals
---------------------------------
• Lift / precision–recall for default model.
• Heatmap: default rate by Credit_Score band × DTI band.
• SHAP summary for feature importance.
