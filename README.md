---

## 🗂 **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains information related to bank customers and their loans, including:

- Customer demographics (age, employment type)  
- Financial details (income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio)  
- Loan information (loan amount, interest rate, loan status)  
- Target variables for **loan approval and default prediction**  

---

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – preprocessing and machine learning models  

---

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**

### 1️⃣ **Data Loading & Understanding**

- Applied **label encoding** to categorical variables  
- Performed **feature scaling** for better model performance  
- Prepared clean data for machine learning  

---

### 3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Performed detailed EDA to understand relationships and patterns:

- Loan amount and income distribution  
- Approval vs default analysis  
- Credit score impact on loan status  
- Debt-to-income ratio analysis  
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps  

📊 **Visualizations Used**
- Histograms  
- Box plots  
- Bar charts  
- Scatter plots  
- Correlation heatmaps

## 🤖 **Machine Learning Models Used**

This is a **classification project**, where machine learning models were applied to predict loan-related outcomes.

### 🔹 **Model Building Process**
- Split data into **training and testing sets**  
- Trained multiple classification models  
- Compared model performance using evaluation metrics  

### 🔹 **Models Implemented**
- **Logistic Regression** – baseline classification model  
- **Decision Tree Classifier** – captured non-linear patterns  
- **Random Forest Classifier** – improved accuracy using ensemble learning

## 📊 **Model Evaluation**
Models were evaluated using standard classification metrics:

- **Accuracy Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

This comparison helped identify the **best-performing model** for loan risk prediction.

---

## 📈 **Key Insights**
- Customers with lower credit scores showed higher default risk  
- Debt-to-income ratio had a strong impact on loan repayment behavior  
- Certain customer segments had higher approval and lower default rates  
- Machine learning models clearly helped identify **risky vs safe customers**

---

## 🧾 **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how **EDA, preprocessing, and machine learning** can be combined to analyze a bank’s loan portfolio.  
It highlights the importance of **data-driven risk assessment** and shows how predictive models can support smarter lending decisions.
